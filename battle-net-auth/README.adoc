= Battle.net Auth Requester
MetroWind

A simple tool to request authenticator key-serial pair from Blizzard.

== Introduction

Blizzard uses the usual
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm[TOTP]
scheme for its authenticator. The usage of TOTP is usually two parts:
the inital setup, and code generation. The former is the process of
getting a key from the account provider, and setting up the latter;
while the latter is the usual practice of generating a code
periodically. This program handlers the majority of the first part.

Usually a good account provider directly gives you a key (probably in
the form of a QR code image) that you can input to your authenticator
program. But Blizzard uses a somewhat convoluted method to hide the
key from the user. The user only sees a “serial number”. I am not sure
exactly why it does it this way, but my guess is that they want to
maintain compatibility with the hardware OTP that they released
before. Anyway It does prevent the user from using a general-purpose
authenticator program such as https://cooperrs.de/otpauth.html[this]
(I am obviously not the author. It is just a really good app).

== Usage

----
USAGE:
    battle-net-auth [OPTIONS] <USER>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --qr-code <FILE>    Generate a QR code at FILE.

ARGS:
    <USER>    User login name of the account
----

Run with your user name, and it will output a serial number and a key
(either as an URI or a QR code). The user name is for your
identification only; it does not participate in code generation. Then
you can input the key into your authenticator program of choice. Most
definitely your program will output 6-digit codes by default. You need
to change that to 8-digit. You will then need to register that serial
number on Blizzard website. Here lies the reason why I suspect
Blizzard uses this scheme to maintain compatibility. For hardward OTP
dangles, the service provider would want to maintain a map between
keys and serial numbers, and the user only sees the serial number.
Blizzard probably wanted to provide a “smooth” experience for users
who transition to the authenticator app.

== Technical notes

The process of requesting a authenticator is reverse-engineered and
documented in
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Battle.net_Mobile_Authenticator_Specification[here],
and there is a pretty good implementation of that in
https://github.com/jleclanche/python-bna[here] (where I shamelessly
ported some code from). Basically the process involves an RSA
encryption and a symmetric decryption.

1. The client constructs a binary request payload, in which encodes a
37-byte https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad[one-time pad],
which is just random bytes.
2. The payload is RSA-encrypted with a known modulus and exponent
(that is the public key from Blizzard), and is sent to Blizzard.
3. Blizzard generates a TOTP key and a serial number, and encrypts
them with the pad from the client by XORing them. It sends the
encrypted data to the client as response.
4. The client decrypts the response by XORing the response again with
the one-time pad, and recovers the key and serial number.
