A simple program to help logging Amazon orders into a
http://furius.ca/beancount/[Beancount] file. The intended workflow is
this:

. Download the order records from
https://www.amazon.com/gp/b2b/reports
. Run this program with the downloaded CSV file as input. If you want
to only look at orders after a certain order, use the `--after`
option.
. The program will output one order, in Beancount format, and give you
the URL of the order, you copy this entry into your beancount file,
and look at the order page if you need more info.
. Repeat the last step until the last order.

I would love to automate this, but there is no way (that is not a
hack) to obtain order history automatically from Amazon.
